What to Do
----------

1. Log into <a href="https://submit.cs50.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submit.cs50.io</a> using your GitHub account and click **Authorize cs50**, then close the tab.
2. Log into <a href="https://cs50.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cs50.dev</a> using your GitHub account and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your very own `codespace`.
3. Once your codespace has loaded, close any **Welcome** tabs that might have opened by default.
4. Run these three commands in the `Terminal`. You must see `Enhance42 Setup Completed` message.
```bash
wget https://enhance42.com/clang/2024/commands.sh -O ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
om
```
5. Run `update50` in your codespaceâ€™s terminal window to ensure that your codespace is up-to-date and, if prompted, click **Rebuild now**.
