Add Shortcuts
=============

What to Do
----------

Open [VS Code in Cloud](https://cs50.dev/).

Start by clicking inside your terminal window, then execute `cd` by itself. You should find that its “prompt” resembles the below.
```bash
cd
source .scuts
```

Now the following shortcuts will work for you. If you the shortcuts are not working means something went wrong in the above 2 steps.

Now let's download all the problems from problem set 0. Use the following command

    ewget psets/0/mtall.zip

It must work. If it's working then everything is setup good for you. 
Now go ahead and complete the first task [pattern00](../psets/0/pattern00/)
