What to Do
----------

1.  Log into [submit.cs50.io](https://submit.cs50.io) using your GitHub account and click **Authorize cs50**, then close the tab.
2.  Log into [cs50.dev](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your very own “codespace.”
3.  Once your codespace has loaded, close any **Welcome** tabs that might have opened by default.
4.  Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure that your codespace is up-to-date and, if prompted, click **Rebuild now**.
5.  [Add Shortcuts](shortcuts.md).

That's all you are all set to run the code in mobile devices as well.
