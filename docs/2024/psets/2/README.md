Problem Set 2 | Create New Commands
=================================== 
The goal is to `create new commands` and `use the new commands` in C programs.  

What to Do
----------

If you have not downloaded `cncall.zip` file already, then do it by running the 5 commands in `Terminal`.

    cd
    source .scuts
    ewget psets/2/cncall.zip
    unzip cncall.zip
    rm cncall.zip

When prompted to remove the file or not, type `yes` or `y`.

In case shortcuts are not working, run the commands:

    cd
    source .scuts

Now  
1.  Submit [cpattern00](cpattern00/).
2.  Submit [cpattern01](cpattern01/).
3.  Submit [cpattern02](cpattern02/).
4.  Submit [cpattern03](cpattern03/).
5.  Submit [cpattern04](cpattern04/).
