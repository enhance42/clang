Problem Set 2 | Create New Commands
=================================== 
The goal is to `create new commands` and `use the new commands` in C programs.  

What to Do
----------

If you have not downloaded `cncall.zip` file already, then do it by running the 5 commands in `Terminal`.

    cd
    ewget psets/2/cncall.zip
    unzip cncall.zip
    rm cncall.zip

When prompted to remove the file or not, type `yes` or `y`.
