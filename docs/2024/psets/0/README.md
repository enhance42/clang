Problem Set 0 | Manual typing
=============================

The goal is to get the end to end process introduction where you can `verify-correctness` and `submit-your-work`.

*Principle*: Introducing `only-one-unknown` at a time.

What to Do
----------

### Download problem set#0
Use the command to download, unzip and rm the downloaded zip file.
```bash
cd
source .scuts
ewget psets/0/mtall.zip
unzip mtall.zip
rm mtall.zip
```
When it prompts like the following type `yes` or `y` and enter.

    rm: remove regular empty file 'mtall.zip'?

Once downloading is done:
1.  Work on [Pattern00](pattern00/).
2.  Work on [Pattern01](pattern01/).
3.  Work on [Pattern02](pattern02/).
4.  Work on [Pattern03](pattern03/).
